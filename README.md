# CSCI200U-finalproject-group9
Introduction:

The dataset focused on movies was chosen for many crutial reasons. First being that it is something everyone in this group has a passion and real interest in. This makes it easier for us to come up with questions we are genuinely fascinated about. Another reason is due to the fact that the dataset, based on our analysis questions, will output staightforward information that can be clearly visulized and intrepeted to come to definite conclusions. Most of our questions are in some way about the rating of specific movies or directors. This is becuase keen on understanding what makes a great, top rated movie. Is it due to the runtime, genre, director, or even the year it was released in. The group members in this group are, Paul Hruda, Garrett Kawabata, and Anthony Liscio> All three group members contributed equally to all parts of the final project to make it an actual group effort. 

Description of data: 

The dataset chosen for our group project is focused on movies. More specifically top rated movies. The data was collected from past movies of all types of genres rated on imdb, into a list from highest rated to lowest. The chosen dataset also includes the years the movies were released in, runtime, director, and more. Also the datset was accesed through a kaggel source and is credited in our proposal. 

Analysis of the data: 

For our data set there are 1000 data records (movies) ranging from 1920 to 2020 with 548 different directors. Some data had to be cleaned up depending on the question since some older movies did not include a met score. In total there are 14 different game genres:

['Drama', 'Crime', 'Action', 'Biography', 'Western', 'Comedy', 'Adventure',
'Animation', 'Horror', 'Mystery', 'Film-Noir', 'Fantasy', 'Family', 'Thriller']

Each Column of the dataset discribed:

• Poster_Link : link to the poster image that is used on IMDB website

• Series_Title : Title of the Movie

• Released_Year : year the movie was released

• Certificate : age rating of the movie

• Runtime : length of the movie in minutes

• Genre : genre of the movie

• IMDB_Rating : movie rating by IMDB

• Overview : brief description of the movie

• Meta_score : critic score of the movie (0-10)

• Director : director of the movie

• Star1, Star2, Star3, Star4 : first four stars of the film

• No_of_Votes : votes

• Gross : money made by the movie

Exploratory Data Analysis: 

1. Based on the results from question one we now know that the top three genres rated by IMDB are Western with an average of 8.00 out of 10, Film-Noir with a 7.99 average, and Mystery with an average of 7.97. With all three rating being so close it seems that with acouple more high rated movies from the second or third placed gengres, Western could no longer be the top rated.

3. Not suprisingly the top rated direcctor that is withing the top reacurring directors is Christopher Nolan, 0.2 higher rated then Stanley Kubrick at second highest rated. However the most the most reacurring director within the data set is Alfred Hitchcock	with a grand total of 14 movies. Since he only directed about fifty films that means that twenty eight percent of his movies made it into the top one thousand of all time.

7.  Therefore the min runtime is 45 minutes while the max runtime is 321 min in the top 1000 rated movies. The min runtime IMDB rating is 8.2 and the max runtime is also 8.2 meaning that we cannot draw a conculsion based on this analysis since both scores are the same. Dissapointingly the resulting meta scores were also a let down. This is becuase the min runtime movie did not have a meta score to display. The max runtime meta score is 89 which is above average, but again no conclusion can be drawn for which movie runtime was higher rated since the two scores can not be compared.

8. Based of the results of question 8 we can analyze that the top rated director of all time according to IMDB is Frank Darabont with an average rating of 8.95. We found it interesting that five out of the ten top directors only had one movie within the top one thousand. This could mean that some of those directors could have made really poor movies with just one great succes. This could then therefore lead us to the conclusion that the true greatest director, not according to IMDB but from our total analytics, is Christopher Nolan or Quentin Tarantino since they have eight movies withing the top one thousand. This is simply becuase this mean they are in the top ten most recurring dircectors and are within the top ten highest rated directors aswell.   


Potential Data Science:

A potential idea when regarding potential data science based on our dataset is to determine what an ideal movie might look like to get the highest rating. This would be achieved by selecting the highest rated or most occuring director along the perfect analyzed runtime within the highest rated genre. This constructed outcome would scientifically have the poper elemnets to possibly become the perfect movie according to IMDB.    

Conclusion:

One major limitation based on this data set when concidering potential data science listed above is that the data set does not state what actor star in each given movie. This can be problematic if trying to see what makes a good movie, since a great actor can sometimes break or make a movie. This leads us to take interest in more data sets around movies that concern and reveal more about the actors in great movies for a possible future direction in analyzing data.
