# CSCI200U-finalproject-group9
Introduction:

The dataset focused on movies was chosen for many crutial reasons. First being that it is something everyone in this group has a passion and real interest in. This makes it easier for us to come up with questions we are genuinely fascinated about. Another reason is due to the fact that the dataset, based on our analysis questions, will output staightforward information that can be clearly visulized and intrepeted to come to definite conclusions. Most of our questions are in some way about the rating of specific movies or directors. This is becuase keen on understanding what makes a great, top rated movie. Is it due to the runtime, genre, director, or even the year it was released in. The group members in this group are, Paul Hruda, Garrett Kawabata, and Anthony Liscio> All three group members contributed equally to all parts of the final project to make it an actual group effort. 

Description of data: 

The dataset chosen for our group project is focused on movies. More specifically top rated movies. The data was collected from past movies of all types of genres rated on imdb, into a list from highest rated to lowest. The chosen dataset also includes the years the movies were released in, runtime, director, and more. Also the datset was accesed through a kaggel source and is credited in our proposal.
