# CSCI2000U-finalproject-group9


Introduction:

The dataset focused on movies was chosen for many crucial reasons. First being that it is something everyone in this group has a passion and real interest in. This makes it easier for us to come up with questions we are genuinely fascinated about. Another reason is due to the fact that the dataset, based on our analysis questions, will output staightforward information that can be clearly visulized and intrepeted to come to definite conclusions. Most of our questions are in some way about the rating of specific movies or directors. This is becuase keen on understanding what makes a great, top rated movie. Is it due to the runtime, genre, director, or even the year it was released in. The group members in this group are, Paul Hruda, Garrett Kawabata, and Anthony Liscio> All three group members contributed equally to all parts of this final project to make it an actual group effort. 

About Us: 

Paul Hruda github user PaulH774, Garrett Kawabata user GarrettKawabata, and Anthony Liscio user anthony9105 are all immense movie lovers. Not all types of movies our are favorites, but nine out of ten of them are. When it comes to marvel movies most of us are there opening night no matter what, so its safe to say action and adventure is our perfered genre of choice. That does not stop us from enjoying all types of movies from mystery to comedy. This is crutial in understanding why we chose this specific data set and how effortless it is for us to come up with meaningful questions and anaylsis material that we actually care about.   

Discussion:

Conclusion:

One major limitation based on this data set when concidering potential data science listed above is that the data set does not state what actor star in each given movie. This can be problematic if trying to see what makes a good movie, since a great actor can sometimes break or make a movie. This leads us to take interest in more data sets around movies that concern and reveal more about the actors in great movies for a possible future direction in analyzing data. One of the most suprising data formed from this data set is that the year 1941 and 1942 had the highest average Meta Score. Another not predicted our come based on our analysis is that the highest rated genre acorring to IMDB is the western genre. This is suprising in our oppinoin becuase with all the good actor movies released recently we assumed that action or adventure would have been the highest rated, but they did not even make top three.
